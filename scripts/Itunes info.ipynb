There is peace and productivity to understanding the seasons of your career.\\n\\nThese seasons are cyclical. You don\\u2019t just do each season once. Some smaller parts of your career will cycle a few times a year. The larger parts tend to cycle slower over many years.',\n",

       "  u\"Why is it that designers seem to do so many things, so well?\\n\\nMassimo Vignelli once said that if you can design one thing, you can design anything.\\n\\nI think there might be something to this. Often designers design great lectures, great studios... great vacations.\\n\\nWhat if we approach our art careers with the design process?\\n\\nWhether you're a designer or not, learning this process can be a game changer.\\n\\nOver time I've realized that most of my ideas surrounding how to make a great art career go back to this design process, and that's what we talk about today.\",\n",
